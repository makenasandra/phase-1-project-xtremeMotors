# Project Description
Xtreme Motors is a platform that provides potential car owners an easier access to units available in the market and help them make informed decisions based on the information shared through the application.

The inventory section displays the car images and relevant information specific to each car including the price point.


Our Application is a Single Page Application that utilizes the `display: none` and `display: block` which allows a User to navigate through different pages within our SPA.


# Project setup instructions

1. Navigate into your working directory.
2. Once in your directory git clone my repository from the GitHub link submitted.
3. Navigate into the repository
4. Run `json-server --watch db.json` to run the server.  Ensure you have json server installled globally. If not, run `npm install -g json-server` on your terminal to make the installation.
5. If you prefer to run on cloud, you can use `npx son-server --watch db.json`
6. Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:
[http://localhost:3000/cars] 

7. Open the live server to view the page.


# Program Features

The MVP of the platform offers a gallery section where potential buyers can look through various cars available and their price tags. Version 2.0 hopefully should provide a modal on each item that gives further information for better decision making.

To make it easier for users, there is a dropdown search menu that enables one to filter through preferred car models.

The search bar also helps those with a known and specific need to look them up easily without sifting through the inventory manually.

Once successful (or not), the user can make an inquiry either regarding a specific car seen in the inventory or make a special request such as direct import orders,financing or any other clarifications
